## üìò Overview

A major cryptocurrency exchange, **XYZ**, was hit with a cyberattack that led to the theft of over **500 BTC** due to poor perimeter security. This project aims to redesign their network securely, implement real-time threat monitoring using a **SIEM**, and guide the organization toward adopting a **Zero Trust Architecture**.

## üîÑ Project Phases

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Network Vulnerability Identification
- Analyzed XYZ‚Äôs insecure flat network.
- All servers were exposed directly to the internet.

### üîÑ Phase 2: Network Redesign
- Segmented network into:
  - **DMZ (Public & Private)** ‚Äì Web & DB servers
  - **Internal Subnet** ‚Äì Internal services
- Added **Firewalls** and **VPN** access for file servers.

### üì¶ Phase 3: VirtualBox Lab Setup
- Configured 3 subnets:
  - `192.168.10.0/24` (Private-DMZ)
  - `192.168.20.0/24` (Public-DMZ)
  - `192.168.30.0/24` (Internal)

### üîç Phase 4: SIEM Setup (Monitoring)
- Installed **ELK Stack** on Private DMZ (Elk-Server)
- Installed **Filebeat** on Web Server (Public DMZ)
- Logs visualized in **Kibana**

### üîê Phase 5: Zero Trust Adoption
- Compared 3 Zero Trust principles to Traditional Security
- Recommended model: **Device Agent & Gateway**
- Ensures per-session access, encrypted communication, and continuous monitoring.
